# Path or URL to sample sheet (TSV format, required columns: sample, fq1, fq2, frac)
# sample - unique sample name
# fq1 and fq2 - paths to paired-end fastq file
# frac - fraction of reads to sample. Set it to 0 or >=1 for no downsampling. Check and set also seed in config.yml to make results reproducible.
